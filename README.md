Machine Vision Assignment
The main purpose of the following assignment was to enhance the understanding of basic machine vision algorithms.
Two images were given and multiple tasks needed to be done with the least use of built-in functions using MATLAB 
The tasks that I completed are as follows :

1. All the tasks for the image 1
  - Display the original image on screen.
  - Threshold the image and convert it into binary image.
  - Determine an one-pixel thin image of the objects.
  - Determine the outline(s).
  - Label the different objects.

2. Tasks (1 to 7) for the image 2
  - Display the original image on screen.
  - Create a binary image using thresholding.
  - Determine a one-pixel thin image of the characters.
  - Determine the outline(s) of characters of the image.
  - Segment the image to separate and label the different characters.
  - Arrange the characters in one line with the sequence: AB123C
  - Rotate the output image from Step 6 about its center by 30 degrees.
